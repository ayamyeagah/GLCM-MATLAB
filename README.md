# GLCM-MATLAB
Try to classify type of mushroom using GLCM in MATLAB
---
Here is the step:
1. Collected a dataset containing 4 classes, each class consisting of 100 images.
2. Convert the image to greyscale and then save it to a new directory.
3. Take data from the grayscale results in the form of GLCM data and set it as input.
4. Set the target as the data label.
5. Trained the data with layers 20 30 4 and 1000 epochs.
6. Set up the GUI as the interface of the program that I made.
